Description:

SaferWay is an Android App that allows users to see the areas around them with a history of crime. This
will help people who do not feel safe walking alone avoid going into notably dangerous places. 

How?

We used the City of Los Angeles's API to gather crime data, and displayed it using the Google Maps API.
